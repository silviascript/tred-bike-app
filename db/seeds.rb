# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# users = User.create([{first_name: 'Christine', last_name: 'Lovett'}, {first_name: 'Amanda', last_name: 'Torres'}, {first_name: 'Thomas', last_name: 'Lovett'}])
rides = Ride.create([{title: 'Rock creek ride'}, {title: 'Potomac River ride'}, {title: 'Capital Crescent Trail'}, {title: 'Mount Vernon Trail'}])
